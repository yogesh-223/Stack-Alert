### Over-all
This is a website inspired from Stack-overflow, customized and for geeks to share, post and help others with programming questions they might be comfortable with 

### Technologies used
The application is built using **Node JS** interface with layout incorporated in **EJS** templates and all styling done with **CSS** and **bootstrap** components. Logistic works have been completed using **EXPRESS** while database used is **mongoDB** through **mongoose**.

### The Idea
The main idea behind this project was just to build an easy to access and customised interface where people with similar mindsets and similar sets of problems which they encounter during their development and programming journey, can come and collaborate to help each other.

### Working
The application works in a simple way. If have a doubt, you can simply post your doubt in the post section and can further track them in the question section. Someone from the community will soon see your question and will answer it for you.
However, if you know the answer to any question and want to contribute, you can choose athe question and answer it, it will be featured in the home page itself. There is also improvement to an answer section where you can improve an answer to a question and it will be featured with your name.

### Carrying Forward
The current application might not be much soothing to the eyes but that was never an issue while building this. An updated application with great UI and Authentication features is on its way of completion and would feature soon. Hang tight !!
